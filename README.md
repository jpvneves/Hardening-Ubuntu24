# Hardening - Ubuntu 24.04.3

---

## Overview
This project was initially envisioned while I was building my homelab. The original idea was to harden my Ubuntu virtual machines using the CIS Benchmark. However, I later scaled down the scope of the project due to not yet being fully knowledgeable about all the required steps and not being fully familiar with the necessary tools.\
The aim of this project is to harden two Ubuntu virtual machines, one desktop and one server, and to catalogue all implemented hardening measures in order to study their effects and the trade-offs they introduce to the system.
