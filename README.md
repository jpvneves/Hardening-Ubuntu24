# General Hardening

---

## Overview
This project aims to serve as a curated repository of system and application hardening measures that I have researched, tested, and understood in depth. It includes hardening guides for operating systems, networks, applications, and so on\
Given the scale and complexity of security hardening, and the fact that I only document measures once I fully understand their behavior, impact, and trade-offs, development progress will be slow and deliberate.

## Goals
- Learn and understand the fundamentals of system hardening
- Practice with the Linux terminal
- Test and practice with multiple hardening and auditing tools
- Build a well documented collection of hardening guides

---

## Limitations
- Not designed for production use
- Limited access to certain platforms and enterprise systems

---

## Roadmap
- Add additional operating systems, applications, networking hardening guides
- Improve existing guides with better explanations and measures
- Incorporate industry standard tools and benchmarks
- Achieve automation where it makes sense
